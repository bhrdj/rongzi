### Challenge:
- Develop a database of Chinese character radical breakdowns.
- Model it as a directed graph.
- Develop an process that can:
    - when given a Chinese poem as an input,
    - find an optimized path stringing the characters together,
    - by moving from character to character via shared components and intermediate characters,
    - while:
        - avoiding using the basic strokes as a component to link characters,
        - minimizing recourse to using "compound" strokes as a component to link characters,
        - using the fewest possible steps,
        - with minimal duplication of characters.
- Present it as a hosted interactive web-app

時時試試、 # Day in day out, try and try,  
視石識世、 # Observe a stone, recognize the world,  
弒獅食屍、 # Kill the elder lion, eat the corpse,  
試釋是事。 # Try to explain this, it is a task.
